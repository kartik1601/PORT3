# PORT3
## Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my expertise and projects that I've built on Web Development.
This portfolio is built using React.JS, Tailwind CSS for styling and 3D effects and visuals using THREE JS library.
Overall, Thanks to JSMastery! Without Adrian this project would've taken me months to figure out, his tutorial helped me build this amazing and responsive website with great visuals.
